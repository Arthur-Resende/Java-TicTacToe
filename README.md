# :hash: Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game in Java.

## :question: How to Play

1. **Clone or Download**: To get started, clone or download this repository to your local machine. You can use the following command if you have Git installed:

```
git clone https://github.com/Arthur-Resende/Java-TicTacToe.git
```

Alternatively, you can download the ZIP archive from the [GitHub page](https://github.com/Arthur-Resende/Java-TicTacToe.git).

2. **Compile the game**: Locate and compile the `Main` class. This class serves as the entry point of the game.

```
cd Java-TicTacToe
javac Main.java
```

3. **Play the Game**: Once the game starts, follow the on-screen instructions to play. You can take turns to place your symbol (X or O) on the board. The game will announce the winner when one player achieves three symbols in a row, column, or diagonal. If all squares are filled, and no one has won, the game will end in a draw.

```
java Main
```

## :notebook: Game Rules

- Two players take turns to mark a square with their symbol (X or O).
- The first player to get three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game.
